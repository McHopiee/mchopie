        "   - Built my own repository with interactive buttons and a personalized About section\n",

        "3. **Learning how to transfer files from one repository to another**  \n",
        "   - Practiced moving files across repositories, an important skill for version control and collaboration\n",
        "   - Learned how to open two repositories at the same time to easily move one file to another \n",
        "   - Also learned how to git pull when the `pages` repository is updated. \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Getting into groups in order to work on projects**  \n",
        "   - Joined a group project and practiced collaboration with peers.\n",
