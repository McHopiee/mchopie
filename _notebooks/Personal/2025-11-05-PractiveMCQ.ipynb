    "\n",
    "1. **Flashcards for core definitions:** Make concise cards for Boolean types, lossless vs lossy encoding, public-key vs symmetric-key cryptography, linear vs binary search, and common logical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loop-tracing practice:** For 10–12 short problems, write out variable values step-by-step for the first 8 iterations. This will help spot increment/display ordering and off-by-one errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Probability to counts:** When faced with proportional spinner or probability questions, convert proportions into integer counts (example: total weight 6 -> 4:1:1) to avoid ratio errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Runtime estimation checklist:** Identify slow/expensive calls in problems, and count how many times they execute. If a function takes significant time, multiply by number of calls rather than assuming a single call.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Modulus and small arithmetic drills:** Practice simple modular arithmetic (e.g., test counts 10,20,30 for count%10==0) and memorize small powers of two (2^5..2^10).\n",
