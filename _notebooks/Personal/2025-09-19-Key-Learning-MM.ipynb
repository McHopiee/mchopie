    "The M&M Make project is a 2D game that Syntax Terrors created by remembering what some of us created in CSSE2, and made it into a game used for learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Planned the game's structure and milestones.\n",
    "- Implemented two distinct game levels (including level transitions).\n",
    "- Implemented player and NPC classes, created the beta interactions but not the finalized interaction.\n",
    "- Reviewed and fixed some of my teammates' commits when they needed help.\n",

    "The steps included:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a canvas, a way for the game to be drawn. Find a place to have this file located in the repository and start making the base for it .. like the adventure game some of us in CSSE2\n",
    "2. What we want to do is have different npcs that the player can talk with. So, we have to create multiple npcs around the map. It is probably a good idea to have the npcs be pretty small, depending on how many steps we want the lesson to be.\n",
    "3. maybe have some kind of challenge after 2-3 npcs to make sure that the player understands how to set up the correct steps to make with theme\n",
    "4. after finishing the npc interactions and learning, have a finale to the game where the blank m&m takes all the colors that they have collected from each npc to finally make themselves colored !\n",
    "\n",
    "I created a project board and broke tasks into milestones, making it so that each step builds onto the last until it was finished!\n",

    "1. **Run the code locally** with the branch checked out and reproduce the bug or failing test.\n",
    "2. **Read the related commit** to understand the intent.\n",
    "3. **Add targeted unit or integration tests** when possible to codify the expected behavior.\n",
    "4. **Make minimal, well-documented changes** and add comments explaining tricky parts.\n",
    "5. **Communicate changes** with a clear summary and a short explanation of the fix.\n",

There was a bit of a commuication bug, but with all bugs, we quickly fixed it. I learned how to successfully plan something out for a big project such as this one, and I learned how to communicate with others in order to divide the work evenly! In git we trust. \n"
