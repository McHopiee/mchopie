  Title: "Food — Back-End & Databases"
  Description: "Cook up coding skills with back-end logic. Each city stop highlights a local food specialty while teaching database design, CRUD, querying, and data hygiene — all framed as kitchen metaphors."
  Cities:
    - Name: "San Diego"
      Description: "Begin your culinary-backend journey in sunny San Diego, where coastal flavors and food trucks meet simple, robust data models."
      Challenge: "Design a simple database schema to store recipes and menu items (tables, fields, and relationships)."
      Analogy: "The database is your kitchen pantry — organize ingredients (fields) and recipes (records) so chefs (applications) can cook reliably."
      Pitstops:
        - Name: "Fish Taco Stand"
          Description: "Study simple record creation and insertion while learning about ingredient lists and portion fields — perfect for practicing CREATE operations."
          Activity: "Create a database table for fish tacos. Include columns: taco_id, fish_type, toppings, sauce, price, spice_level. Write the CREATE TABLE statement with appropriate data types."
          Hints:
            - "Start with CREATE TABLE fish_tacos ()"
            - "Use INT for taco_id and make it PRIMARY KEY"
            - "VARCHAR(50) works well for text fields like fish_type"
            - "Consider DECIMAL(5,2) for price to handle dollars and cents"
            - "Use ENUM for spice_level: ('mild', 'medium', 'hot')"
        - Name: "California Burrito Cart"
          Description: "Model composite dishes with nested ingredients and optional fields — practice designing flexible schemas that handle variations."
          Activity: "Design a burrito customization system. Create tables for: burritos, ingredients, and burrito_ingredients (junction table). Show how to handle optional extras like guacamole."
          Hints:
            - "Create three separate tables: burritos, ingredients, burrito_ingredients"
            - "The junction table needs foreign keys to both other tables"
            - "Use BOOLEAN for optional extras like is_extra_guac"
            - "Consider adding quantity field to junction table"
            - "Don't forget PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints"
        - Name: "Ceviche Counter"
          Description: "Learn input validation and sanitization (keep the ceviche fresh!) — apply validation rules before inserting records."
          Activity: "Write an INSERT statement for a new ceviche recipe. Include validation checks: fish must be 'fresh', citrus_time must be between 10-60 minutes, temperature must be 'cold'."
          Hints:
            - "Use CHECK constraints: CHECK (fish_quality = 'fresh')"

          Activity: "Create a sauce lookup table with default values. Design tables: sauces (id, name, heat_level), dishes (id, name, default_sauce_id). Show how to use foreign keys and defaults."
          Hints:
            - "Create sauces table first, then reference it in dishes table"
            - "Use AUTO_INCREMENT for sauce IDs"
            - "Set DEFAULT value: default_sauce_id INT DEFAULT 1"
            - "Add FOREIGN KEY constraint: FOREIGN KEY (default_sauce_id) REFERENCES sauces(id)"
            - "Populate sauces table first with INSERT statements"
    - Name: "Los Angeles"
      Description: "In sprawling LA, scale matters — design systems that handle many users, varied inputs, and richer interactions."
      Challenge: "Implement Create and Read operations (APIs or SQL) and build endpoints that return menu lists and single recipe entries."
      Analogy: "Think of APIs as waitstaff taking orders — they must correctly accept, validate, and retrieve dishes from the kitchen (database)."
      Pitstops:

            - "Handle optional parameters with dynamic WHERE building"
            - "Consider using prepared statements for safety"
            - "Return JSON format: {'tacos': [array of taco objects]}"
