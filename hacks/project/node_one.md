  Title: "Glitched Forest — Logic & Flow"
  Description: >
    Learn how programs execute step-by-step. Explore conditionals, loops,
    and common logic/syntax errors through short examples and interactive fixes.
  Audience: "High school juniors & sophomores — intro CS"
  LearningObjectives:
    - "Explain how programs execute line-by-line and the role of control flow."
    - "Identify basic syntax and logic errors in short programs."
    - "Apply simple debugging strategies to fix conditional and loop issues."
  Topics:
    - Title: "What is control flow?"
      Description: "An introduction to sequencing, conditionals (if/else), and loops (for, while)."
      Example: "if score > 100: print('High score!')"
    - Title: "Common syntax errors"
      Description: "Missing colons, incorrect indentation, and misplaced parentheses — how they break programs."
      Example: "if (x > 5) print(x)  ->  if (x > 5): print(x)"
    - Title: "Logic errors vs syntax errors"
      Description: "Why a program that runs can still be wrong — tests and reasoning help reveal logical mistakes."
    - Title: "Debugging steps"
      Description: "Reproduce, isolate, hypothesize, test — iterate until fixed."
