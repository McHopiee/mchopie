  Title: "Food — Back-End & Databases"
  Description: "Cook up coding skills with back-end logic. Each city stop highlights a local food specialty while teaching database design, CRUD, querying, and data hygiene — all framed as kitchen metaphors."
  Cities:
    - Name: "San Diego"
      Description: "Begin your culinary-backend journey in sunny San Diego, where coastal flavors and food trucks meet simple, robust data models."
      Challenge: "Design a simple database schema to store recipes and menu items (tables, fields, and relationships)."
      Analogy: "The database is your kitchen pantry — organize ingredients (fields) and recipes (records) so chefs (applications) can cook reliably."
      Pitstops:
        - Name: "Fish Taco Stand"
          Description: "Study simple record creation and insertion while learning about ingredient lists and portion fields — perfect for practicing CREATE operations."
        - Name: "California Burrito Cart"
          Description: "Model composite dishes with nested ingredients and optional fields — practice designing flexible schemas that handle variations."
        - Name: "Ceviche Counter"
          Description: "Learn input validation and sanitization (keep the ceviche fresh!) — apply validation rules before inserting records."
        - Name: "Baja Sauce Workshop"
          Description: "Explore default values and lookup tables (sauces, spice levels) to avoid repeating strings across many records."
    - Name: "Los Angeles"
      Description: "In sprawling LA, scale matters — design systems that handle many users, varied inputs, and richer interactions."
      Challenge: "Implement Create and Read operations (APIs or SQL) and build endpoints that return menu lists and single recipe entries."
      Analogy: "Think of APIs as waitstaff taking orders — they must correctly accept, validate, and retrieve dishes from the kitchen (database)."
      Pitstops:
        - Name: "Koreatown BBQ Grill"
          Description: "Practice INSERT operations and transactional groupings — order the BBQ set (multiple related inserts) reliably and atomically."
        - Name: "Street Taco Row"
          Description: "Design REST endpoints for listing and filtering tacos by fillings and toppings — practice Read operations with query parameters."
        - Name: "Avocado Toast Café"
          Description: "Handle user-supplied customizations safely (input validation and parameterized queries) to prevent broken orders and injection risks."
        - Name: "Farmers Market Depot"
          Description: "Build APIs that support pagination and filtering — return smaller, efficient result sets when menus are large."
    - Name: "San Francisco"
      Description: "Tech-forward and detail-oriented, San Francisco emphasizes efficiency, indexing, and shaping data for fast access."
      Challenge: "Implement Read and Update operations; practice indexing, query optimization, and writing efficient SELECT statements."
      Analogy: "Indexing is like organizing your pantry by frequency of use — frequently used ingredients should be easy to reach to speed up cooking (queries)."
      Pitstops:
        - Name: "Sourdough Bakery"
          Description: "Learn indexing basics: choose which fields to index (e.g., recipe name, tag) to speed retrieval of common queries."
        - Name: "Seafood Market"
          Description: "Practice JOINs and relational queries to combine ingredient, supplier, and recipe tables — like assembling a seafood platter from multiple sources."
        - Name: "Dim Sum Alley"
          Description: "Explore denormalization vs normalization trade-offs for read-heavy operations — when to duplicate data for speed."
        - Name: "Sourdough Starter Lab"
          Description: "Understand caching strategies and materialized views to avoid recomputing expensive queries every request."
    - Name: "Seattle"
      Description: "Finish in Seattle where reliability, deployment, and observability matter — prepare your kitchen for production service."
      Challenge: "Implement Update and Delete operations safely; set up backups, migrations, and a simple deployment of your database-backed app."
      Analogy: "Deployment is like opening your restaurant — you must ensure recipes are reproducible, backups are ready, and orders are tracked."
      Pitstops:
        - Name: "Salmon Smokehouse"
          Description: "Practice safe UPDATE and DELETE operations with transactions and soft-deletes (archiving) to avoid accidental data loss."
        - Name: "Coffee Roastery"
          Description: "Set up logging and basic monitoring for your database queries and endpoints — know when the app is under pressure (high load)."
        - Name: "Pike Place Backup Cellar"
          Description: "Learn backup strategies and simple migration patterns to evolve schemas without losing customer data."
        - Name: "PWA Food Truck Pier"
          Description: "Deploy a small API-backed demo (Heroku/Vercel/Netlify + managed DB) and ensure it responds reliably to real requests."
